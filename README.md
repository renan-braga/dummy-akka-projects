# Dummy Akka Projects

This repository contains a collection of small experimental projects built with Akka, aimed at learning and exploring both basic and advanced concepts of the Akka framework for building concurrent, distributed, and reactive systems.

## Objective

The main goal of this repository is to **learn more about Akka** by creating simple, hands-on projects that demonstrate key concepts such as:
- The Actor Model using **Akka Typed**
- Asynchronous message communication between actors
- Managing immutable state within actors
- (Optional) Integrating with other parts of the Akka ecosystem like Akka Streams and Akka HTTP

These projects are not intended to be production-ready applications but rather educational examples to help you understand and experiment with Akka.
